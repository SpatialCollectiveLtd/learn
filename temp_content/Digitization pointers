MAPPING ROAD MAP (Mappers/Validators) (App’s Use)
[All parties need to have a Laptop and a Mouse for Work and a Phone for communication purposes]
Mapper:
1. Overview and Requirements


What you’ll learn
Digital mapping
Satellite image interpretation
Using mapping tools (JOSM, HOT Tasking Manager)
Working with global mapping communities
Requirements Before they Start
A laptop or desktop (not a phone)
Mouse (a trackpad is difficult to use)
Gmail account
Why Are We Doing This?


Your work helps real-world change by supporting:
Humanitarian organizations
Health planners
Disaster response teams
Local development and infrastructure projects
How the Work Is Structured
You map as an individual but as part of a larger team.
Each task is a section (grid square) of a larger project.
A validator will check your work.
You’ll be paid based on volume, accuracy, and quality.
2. Account Setup Steps


Follow these steps to set up the necessary accounts:


Step 1: Email
Create a Gmail account (if you don’t have one).
Step 2: OSM Account
Visit: openstreetmap.org
Sign up with your email.
Step 3: HOT Tasking Manager
Visit: tasks.hotosm.org
Log in using your OSM account.
Authorize it to connect (HOT Authorization).
3. Installing and Setting Up JOSM


Follow these steps to prepare the Java OpenStreetMap Editor (JOSM) for mapping:


Step 1: Installation
Run the installer provided to you and open the program.
Step 2: Enable Remote Control
Go to Preferences.
Enable Remote Control.
Make sure all the boxes are checked.
Step 3: Configure OSM Server
Go to Preferences.
Select OSM Server: Basic Auth.
Enter your OSM Username and Password.
4. Mapping: Drawing Buildings in JOSM


Understanding Aerial Imagery
You’ll use satellite images to identify buildings.
Look for: Roof outlines, Regular shapes (rectangular, square).
Avoid: Cars, Trees, Shadows.
Use Bing or Maxar imagery layers in JOSM.
How to Draw Buildings in JOSM
Use the building tool (press B).
Click around the edges of the building.
Double-click to close the shape.
Tag the shape with: building=yes.
Avoid:
Overlapping buildings.
Buildings with less than 3 nodes.
Freehand shapes.
Types of Buildings and Tagging


Examples of building tags to use:
Building = Construction
Building = Yes
Building = Foundation
(Refer to the Tagging section of the manual for more details)
5. Validation and Quality Control


Self Validation


Before uploading your work, always validate it:
Press Shift + V to validate in JOSM or on the left panel press the {✔}icon.
Fix common errors:
Building inside building
Overlapping shapes
Improper tags
Hanging or duplicate nodes
Good validation = faster approval = better pay.
Validation Checks
Make sure all buildings are digitized.
Make sure buildings are not overlapping each other.
Digitize and shape building outlines correctly (refer to the manual's examples of "Incorrect" vs. "Correct" shapes).
6. Task Workflow


Accessing the Tasking Manager
Go to tasks.hotosm.org.
Click “Explore Projects.”
Search by the given project number.
Click “Contribute.”
Pick a square (task) on the map.
Click “Map selected task.”
Locking and Opening a Task in JOSM
Make sure JOSM is running.
Ensure Remote Control is enabled in JOSM Preferences.
In the Tasking Manager, click “Map selected task.”
JOSM will ask to approve the request; click OK.
The selected task and imagery will open in JOSM.
Marking Your Task as Complete (Uploading)
Once your work is finished, click the upload button in JOSM (up arrow icon).
Fix any validation errors first (if any).
Add a comment, such as “Mapped buildings.”
Click Upload Changes.
Return to the Tasking Manager.
Under Task Status, select Yes.
Submit your task.
What to Do If You Can’t Finish a Task
Save your progress and upload it (to the server).
Go back to the Tasking Manager:
Under Task Status, select No.
Submit the task.
Note your task number so you can reopen it later
